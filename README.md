# CPU Scheduler Battle: Race of the Algorithms

A Python-based visualization and simulation project for comparing classic CPU scheduling algorithms in a race-style format. Built as part of our Operating Systems Capstone Project (Spring 2025), this tool demonstrates process scheduling strategies through real-time Gantt charts, metric tracking, and performance comparison.

## Project Overview

**Goal:**  
Simulate and visualize how different CPU scheduling algorithms handle the same workload. Each algorithm "races" to finish processing the same set of tasks, and their performance is ranked using key OS metrics.

**Core Algorithms Implemented:**
- First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Priority Scheduling
- Round Robin
